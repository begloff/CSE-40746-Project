Grasp dumbbells with each hand under legs. Position elbows with slight bend with palms facing together behind ankles (as shown) or just to sides of ankles.~Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height. Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and fixed elbow position (10Â° to 30Â° angle) throughout exercise. Maintain elbows height above wrists by raising "pinkie finger" side up. Lower and repeat.~Dumbbells are raised by shoulder transverse abduction, not external rotation, nor extension. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. This mean at top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward. To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep upper torso close to horizontal. Positioning upper torso at 45Â° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. The spine can be flexed to achieve this positioning if thighs can provide sufficient support for torso. Some individuals may not be able to bend sufficiently at hip due to flexibility or girth constraints.

Repeat.~Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion.Â If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~10~323000

481~15~Smith Bent-over Row~Smith~Other~Other~Other~Other~Other~Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpgwb9kq8a5kKkyqELVLppfo7kjsMiAcgdcV6Nxd60oXda8nHipcUzVu4sLQ&amp;s~3~10900000

1141~29~Suspended Hanging Leg Hip Raise~Suspended~Basic~Compound~Pull~Stand below suspension trainer handles positioned up high. Grasp handles above.~Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended downward. Repeat.~If handles cannot be positioned high enough, knees can be kept partially bent near bottom so hips can be extended fully. If knees are not extended at botton, Rectus Femoris becomes synergist. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only dynamically contract if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible.

1474~32~Vertical Twisting Leg Raise (on dip bar)~Twisting Leg Raises~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Stand between parallel bars and grip bar on each side with overhand grip. Lift body off floor and balance body upright with arms straight.~Raise legs to one side by flexing hips and knees until hips are completely flexed or knees areÂ above hips. Return until hips and knees are extended downward. Raise legs to opposite side in same manner. Continue by bending and lifting legs, alternating between sides.~Obliques are largely exercised isometrically with relatively little movement. Obliques and Rectus Abdominis only contract dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. Conversely, rotation of spine occurs perpendicular to line force (ie: gravity).

1828~35~Cable Lying Hip Internal Rotation~Cable~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, furthest low pulley. Step near foot over cable and lie prone perpendicular to cable. Bend knee 90Â° so attached ankle crosses over resting straight leg nearest pulley. Adjust positioning of legs slightly away from cable pulley so slight stretch is felt in hip.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return leg to original position toward pulley and repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite direction.~Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, internal rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite bent leg moving outward. Incidentally, if knee were straight during internal rotation of thigh, foot would move inward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7NP4-L9wSg6alo1uFZuHJbb9loDzChcvx81lAkeGjEC_zDhdnwP3Mon8aajY&amp;s~7~2170000
1829~35~Cable Seated Hip Internal Rotation~Cable~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Sit on bench or chair with low pulley to side. Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle furthest pulley. Place foot of stationary leg just forward of foot attached to cable. Grasp bench and handle bar on cable column if available. Position thighs of both legs side by side, perpendicular to cable. Raise foot attached to cable slightly off of floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return foot behind stationary foot and toward pulley. Repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor, thereby anchoring lower body as hip abductors keep thighs in place.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTsUzTl0x7wdNHvlU56tVJkPv9JfIN3KnBKeN9K0jisEYjM6Wzlza6-EUqllug&amp;s~8~1290000

1930~37~Cable Seated Hip External Rotation~Other~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Sit on bench or chair with low pulley to side. Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, nearest pulley. Place far stationary foot slightly forward. Grasp lower thigh of leg with attached cuff, position it along side thigh of stationary leg while keeping foot slightly above floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward. Incidentally if knee were straight during external rotation of thigh, foot would move outward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMa0S3pcWRRIN-CkcIokr2aRBKSkRAGzcmgWZMz9GY0EiVMjmSaNZgNxEF&amp;s~8~1210000

Extend left arm back alongside body and bend right arm under shoulder. Push off explosively with both legs.~Sprint and attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible toward turn-around line or cone. Decelerate just before crossing line or approaching cone. Run around cone or quickly change direction immediately after crossing line. Sprint back to starting point, again attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible. Sprint without further deceleration until passing over initial starting line.~Sprinting on balls of feet, as opposed to toes, creates maximum push off on ground and forward acceleration. During the acceleration phase, keep footâs point of contact slightly behind center of mass. Overstriding in acceleration phase places footâs point of contact too far forward thereby slowing speed. Therefore begin with slightly shorter steps while extending length and speed of each stride throughout acceleration phase. During deceleration phase, heels can make initial contact with ground.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT2xAyFxHlCz5soR_VTmCbS2ldlcz_c2u3KZ9XeTC5Nyq7cDH8WpJusVPO5gw&amp;s~1~77400000
