Allow shoulder with stirrup to be pulled forward with twist through waist.~Pull cable attachment to side of torso and rotate body toward side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and push chest forward. Return until arm is extended and shoulder is pulled forward. Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.~In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal rotation / transverse adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of support.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQL8OM2T4XrDwldCM3in7mDU4U1TXgXIzBfWYTchMtW5Vm_RpPKbH-0aaDR1Q&amp;s~7~1720000

Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.~Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.~Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don't position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~10~323000

481~15~Smith Bent-over Row~Smith~Other~Other~Other~Other~Other~Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpgwb9kq8a5kKkyqELVLppfo7kjsMiAcgdcV6Nxd60oXda8nHipcUzVu4sLQ&amp;s~3~10900000

1141~29~Suspended Hanging Leg Hip Raise~Suspended~Basic~Compound~Pull~Stand below suspension trainer handles positioned up high. Grasp handles above.~Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended downward. Repeat.~If handles cannot be positioned high enough, knees can be kept partially bent near bottom so hips can be extended fully. If knees are not extended at botton, Rectus Femoris becomes synergist. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only dynamically contract if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible.

1474~32~Vertical Twisting Leg Raise (on dip bar)~Twisting Leg Raises~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Stand between parallel bars and grip bar on each side with overhand grip. Lift body off floor and balance body upright with arms straight.~Raise legs to one side by flexing hips and knees until hips are completely flexed or knees are above hips. Return until hips and knees are extended downward. Raise legs to opposite side in same manner. Continue by bending and lifting legs, alternating between sides.~Obliques are largely exercised isometrically with relatively little movement. Obliques and Rectus Abdominis only contract dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. Conversely, rotation of spine occurs perpendicular to line force (ie: gravity).

1828~35~Cable Lying Hip Internal Rotation~Cable~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, furthest low pulley. Step near foot over cable and lie prone perpendicular to cable. Bend knee 90° so attached ankle crosses over resting straight leg nearest pulley. Adjust positioning of legs slightly away from cable pulley so slight stretch is felt in hip.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return leg to original position toward pulley and repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite direction.~Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, internal rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite bent leg moving outward. Incidentally, if knee were straight during internal rotation of thigh, foot would move inward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7NP4-L9wSg6alo1uFZuHJbb9loDzChcvx81lAkeGjEC_zDhdnwP3Mon8aajY&amp;s~7~2170000

Place foot of stationary leg just forward of foot attached to cable. Grasp bench and handle bar on cable column if available. Position thighs of both legs side by side, perpendicular to cable. Raise foot attached to cable slightly off of floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return foot behind stationary foot and toward pulley. Repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor, thereby anchoring lower body as hip abductors keep thighs in place.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTsUzTl0x7wdNHvlU56tVJkPv9JfIN3KnBKeN9K0jisEYjM6Wzlza6-EUqllug&amp;s~8~1290000

1930~37~Cable Seated Hip External Rotation~Other~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Sit on bench or chair with low pulley to side. Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, nearest pulley. Place far stationary foot slightly forward. Grasp lower thigh of leg with attached cuff, position it along side thigh of stationary leg while keeping foot slightly above floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward. Incidentally if knee were straight during external rotation of thigh, foot would move outward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMa0S3pcWRRIN-CkcIokr2aRBKSkRAGzcmgWZMz9GY0EiVMjmSaNZgNxEF&amp;s~8~1210000

2164~39~Lever Standing Leg Curl~Lever (selectorized)~Auxiliary or Basic~Isolated~Pull~Stand in machine with one or both legs between pads depending upon machine's design. Position exercising leg with lever pad behind lower leg and upper pad in front of lower thigh. Bend over and grasp handles for support if available. Stand with body weight shifted on foot of resting leg and raise foot of exercising leg slightly off of floor or platform.~Pull lever up to back of thigh by flexing knee. Return lever until knee is straight. Repeat. Continue with opposite leg.~Some apparatuses allow for a bent over posture potentially further decreasing active insufficiency of three of four heads of hamstring at completion of knee flexion. If hips are not significantly bent (ie: body upright), Rectus Femoris becomes antagonist stabilizers. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Similar exercise can also be performed on some multi-hip machines and certain leg extension machines.

2167~39~Lever Standing Leg Curl (on multi-hip machine)~Lever (selectorized)~Auxiliary or Basic~Isolated~Pull~Adjust platform to highest position or lever fulcrum to lowest position so fulcrum is at height of knee. If necessary, place extra elevation near end of platform to stand on, so knee is aligned with fulcrum. Adjust padded roller approximately 45° downward. Step on extra elevation facing padded roller. Place leg closest to lever over roller. Bend over at hips and grasp bar. Slightly extend hip to lower roller so knee maintains alignment with fulcrum.~Pull padded roller to glutes by flexing knee. Lower padded roller until knee is straight. Repeat. Reposition roller pad lever and continue with opposite leg.~Taller individuals may only be able to perform this exercise on standard multi-hip machine if adjustments are not sufficient to position knee at same height of fulcrum. If needed, raise body slightly by raising heel for proper knee alignment. Disregard calf as stabilizer if this is not necessary. Maintain knee position to lever throughout exercise. Shorter individuals may find it difficult to position body high enough even with elevation.

Keep low back straight, maintaining approximate height from floor throughout movement. Hamstrings seemingly acts as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only slightly, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Apart from Sartorius involvement, flexion of hips is largely passive and is accomplished by eccentric contraction of glutes during concentric contraction of hamstrings.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQPosOkaQKCYFnfbpURRjQNmsYCwCVV0gqV9_peDnCHcf2KWJCvvrxqNBUdI94&amp;s~4~6570000

If lying on bench, grasp end or sides of bench with each hand. Raise body off of bench or floor by extending hip of attached leg while keeping knee of same leg and low back straight.~While keeping unattached leg extended, pull heel attached to suspension trainer toward rear end by bending knee and hip simultaneously. Return to original position by straightening knees and hips. Repeat.~Keep low back straight and maintain consistent height from floor throughout movement. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist in knee flexion.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRfloORpr-sKP8YrIBm3pEzmRcGt5FvvCQDmG-5bDS15cwPFX8MITDP-Jv1bg&amp;s~1~56200000
2198~39~Suspended Single Leg Curl (leg flexed)~Suspended~Auxiliary or Basic~Isolated~Pull~Sit on floor or bench facing suspension trainer loop in low position. Place heel in loop with sole contacting handle. Lie down and straighten leg attached to suspension trainer. Position other leg toward body with hip and knee fully bent. If lying on floor, place arms on floor off to sides. If lying on bench, grasp end or sides of bench with each hand. Raise body off of bench or floor by extending hip of attached leg while keeping knee of same leg and low back straight.~Pull heel attached to suspension trainer toward rear end by bending knee and hip simultaneously. Return to original position by straightening knees and hips. Repeat.~Keep low back straight and maintain consistent height from floor throughout movement. Hamstrings seemingly act as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only about 50%, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRfloORpr-sKP8YrIBm3pEzmRcGt5FvvCQDmG-5bDS15cwPFX8MITDP-Jv1bg&amp;s~2~24400000

Repeat.~This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer. See Suspended Supine Feet Mount/Dismount. Keep low back straight, maintaining approximate height from floor throughout movement. On most popular suspension trainers, keep lower body weight equally distributed on each side to prevent slippage. Some makes of suspension trainers do not have this slack in their design, so one leg can relax momentarily in straight position, while bent side bears most of resistance, allowing for a more dynamic contraction in this specific movement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhAWytQvJtdNzuIRGn9go4WchpUuueBKI_Wl2-xWhBNtsLiMPS7MVh8I0XAQ&amp;s~4~4940000

When feet are over hurdle extend legs forward and pull arms down toward sides. Land on both legs, squat down to absorb impact, and stand upright.~Hurdle should be collapsible in case it is not cleared. Jump requires static spinal extension as body initially extends and during landing. However, spinal flexion occurs as legs are pulled upward, following complete hip flexion in effort to raise legs to maximal height. Consequently, dynamic spinal extension is observed when hips and body are re-extended.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSio8iDk7etT2X8BYruJ_ldtIqPlK1UDo4i0AQcEr6A3FEzQDOx_xA-xdvNeQ&amp;s~3~11900000

Extend left arm back alongside body and bend right arm under shoulder. Push off explosively with both legs.~Sprint and attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible toward turn-around line or cone. Decelerate just before crossing line or approaching cone. Run around cone or quickly change direction immediately after crossing line. Sprint back to starting point, again attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible. Sprint without further deceleration until passing over initial starting line.~Sprinting on balls of feet, as opposed to toes, creates maximum push off on ground and forward acceleration. During the acceleration phase, keep foot’s point of contact slightly behind center of mass. Overstriding in acceleration phase places foot’s point of contact too far forward thereby slowing speed. Therefore begin with slightly shorter steps while extending length and speed of each stride throughout acceleration phase. During deceleration phase, heels can make initial contact with ground.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT2xAyFxHlCz5soR_VTmCbS2ldlcz_c2u3KZ9XeTC5Nyq7cDH8WpJusVPO5gw&amp;s~1~77400000
