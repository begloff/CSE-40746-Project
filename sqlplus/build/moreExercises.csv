Extend left arm back alongside body and bend right arm under shoulder. Push off explosively with both legs.~Sprint and attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible toward turn-around line or cone. Decelerate just before crossing line or approaching cone. Run around cone or quickly change direction immediately after crossing line. Sprint back to starting point, again attempt to accelerate as quickly as possible. Sprint without further deceleration until passing over initial starting line.~Sprinting on balls of feet, as opposed to toes, creates maximum push off on ground and forward acceleration. During the acceleration phase, keep foot’s point of contact slightly behind center of mass. Overstriding in acceleration phase places foot’s point of contact too far forward thereby slowing speed. Therefore begin with slightly shorter steps while extending length and speed of each stride throughout acceleration phase. During deceleration phase, heels can make initial contact with ground.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT2xAyFxHlCz5soR_VTmCbS2ldlcz_c2u3KZ9XeTC5Nyq7cDH8WpJusVPO5gw&amp;s
