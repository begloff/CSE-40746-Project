434~15~Lever Bent-over Row (plate loaded)~Lever (plate loaded)~~~~~~Torso should be kept horizontal if flexibility allows. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, try bending knees more. Placing weight plates on higher bar lightens resistance at top where strength lessens, without compromising range of motion. See Gravity Vectors to understand how this positioning, altering direction of load, affects exercise resistance (resistance curve). Also see wide grip form.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~5~2140000
435~15~Lever Barbell Bent-over Row (plate loaded)~Lever (plate loaded)~Basic or Auxiliary~Compound~Pull~Stand with toes under bar facing fulcrum. Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.~Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.~Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don&#39;t position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~9~323000

481~15~Smith Bent-over Row~Smith~~~~~~Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpgwb9kq8a5kKkyqELVLppfo7kjsMiAcgdcV6Nxd60oXda8nHipcUzVu4sLQ&amp;s~2~10900000

Grasp handles above.~Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended downward. Repeat.~If handles cannot be positioned high enough, knees can be kept partially bent near bottom so hips can be extended fully. If knees are not extended at botton, Rectus Femoris becomes synergist. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only dynamically contract if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible.

Walk forward on ball and lie back on ball with shoulders and head hanging off and knees and hips bent. Gently hyperextend back to contour of ball. Hold plate behind neck or on chest with both hands or use no weight.~Flex waist to raise upper torso. Return to original position and repeat.~Weight can be held behind neck. Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum. Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed. Movement can be made easier by positioning hips low on ball. In contrast, exercise can be made more challenging by positioning ball lower on back and hips higher. Some individuals may experience low back discomfort if hips are not bent, so they must use smaller ball size or lower their hip position on ball.

1828~35~Cable Lying Hip Internal Rotation~Cable~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, furthest low pulley. Step near foot over cable and lie prone perpendicular to cable. Bend knee 90° so attached ankle crosses over resting straight leg nearest pulley. Adjust positioning of legs slightly away from cable pulley so slight stretch is felt in hip.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return leg to original position toward pulley and repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite direction.~Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, internal rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite bent leg moving outward. Incidentally, if knee were straight during internal rotation of thigh, foot would move inward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7NP4-L9wSg6alo1uFZuHJbb9loDzChcvx81lAkeGjEC_zDhdnwP3Mon8aajY&amp;s~5~2170000

Place foot of stationary leg just forward of foot attached to cable. Grasp bench and handle bar on cable column if available. Position thighs of both legs side by side, perpendicular to cable. Raise foot attached to cable slightly off of floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return foot behind stationary foot and toward pulley. Repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor, thereby anchoring lower body as hip abductors keep thighs in place.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTsUzTl0x7wdNHvlU56tVJkPv9JfIN3KnBKeN9K0jisEYjM6Wzlza6-EUqllug&amp;s~7~1290000

Repeat.~Exercise can be performed on bench. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible (see Cable Lying Leg-Hip Raise).

Keep low back straight, maintaining approximate height from floor throughout movement. Hamstrings seemingly acts as a dynamic stabilizer, since it shortens through knee, while it lengthens through hip. However, net contraction actually appears to occur, since hip flexes only slightly, while knee flexes nearly 100%, allowing hamstrings to remain in a mechanically strong position throughout movement. Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Apart from Sartorius involvement, flexion of hips is largely passive and is accomplished by eccentric contraction of glutes during concentric contraction of hamstrings.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQPosOkaQKCYFnfbpURRjQNmsYCwCVV0gqV9_peDnCHcf2KWJCvvrxqNBUdI94&amp;s~3~6570000
