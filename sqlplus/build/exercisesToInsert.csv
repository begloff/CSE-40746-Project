To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep upper torso close to horizontal. Positioning upper torso at 45Â° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. The spine can be flexed to achieve this positioning if thighs can provide sufficient support for torso. Some individuals may not be able to bend sufficiently at hip due to flexibility or girth constraints.

Allow shoulder with stirrup to be pulled forward with twist through waist.~Pull cable attachment to side of torso and rotate body toward side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and push chest forward. Return until arm is extended and shoulder is pulled forward. Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.~In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation contribute to body&#39;s rotation. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal rotation / transverse adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of support.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQL8OM2T4XrDwldCM3in7mDU4U1TXgXIzBfWYTchMtW5Vm_RpPKbH-0aaDR1Q&amp;s~6~1720000

Repeat and continue with opposite arm.~Allow scapula to articulate but do not rotate torso in effort to throw weight up. Torso should be close to horizontal. Positioning supporting knee and/or arm slightly forward or back will allow for proper levelling of torso. Torso may be positioned lower to allow for heavier dumbbell to make contact with floor, if desired.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQc_0UNXyKzmSv2NnbYnJ0CJEdojbUcMn_Vo_tdNUHa5xatTMe5M8g9pfBdlg&amp;s~5~0

434~15~Lever Bent-over Row (plate loaded)~Lever (plate loaded)~~~~~~Torso should be kept horizontal if flexibility allows. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, try bending knees more. Placing weight plates on higher bar lightens resistance at top where strength lessens, without compromising range of motion. See Gravity Vectors to understand how this positioning, altering direction of load, affects exercise resistance (resistance curve). Also see wide grip form.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~5~2140000

Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip.~Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched downward. Repeat.~Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever. Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either try bending knees more or don&#39;t position torso as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi, since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion.Â If low back is rounded due to poor form, grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while slightly emphasizing Rear Delt, Infraspinatus and Teres Minor involvement.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCprmI3aMm9ezVA46s9xLgbg-GCX5FNbJG_PED8cFAugld2rPkyvA4nAMj-eo&amp;s~9~323000

481~15~Smith Bent-over Row~Smith~~~~~~Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpgwb9kq8a5kKkyqELVLppfo7kjsMiAcgdcV6Nxd60oXda8nHipcUzVu4sLQ&amp;s~2~10900000

1044~29~Weighted Sit-up (arms crossed)~Sit-ups~Basic~Compound~Pull~Hook feet under support and lie supine on floor or mat with hips and knees bent. With both hands, hold plate on chest with forearms crossed or use no weight.~Raise torso from floor by bending waist and hips. Return until back of shoulders contact with floor or mat. Repeat.~If feet are close to hips, bent arms can be lifted above knees, allowing for complete range of motion resulting in a more bell shaped resistance curve (ie: lessened resistance at top of movement) due to more varying force vectors against gravity. The same can be accomplished by placing feet slightly further away from hips, requiring no need to lift arms above knees (as shown).~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRX6L8JH8-UqTZjJf5OdnP_JTBnQktjuWsF1nZNhjaxXhu8g4lzxGXIjIgJ-xU&amp;s~1~42600000

Repeat.~Try to keep elbows nearly straight throughout exercise. Target muscle, Rectus Abdominis practically contracts isometrically since only a small degree of waist flexion occurs under resistance and, with the assistance of the External Oblique, act to stabilize spine. See target muscle of rollout question.

1141~29~Suspended Hanging Leg Hip Raise~Suspended~Basic~Compound~Pull~Stand below suspension trainer handles positioned up high. Grasp handles above.~Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended downward. Repeat.~If handles cannot be positioned high enough, knees can be kept partially bent near bottom so hips can be extended fully. If knees are not extended at botton, Rectus Femoris becomes synergist. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only dynamically contract if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible.

1828~35~Cable Lying Hip Internal Rotation~Cable~Auxiliary~Isolated~Pull~Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle, furthest low pulley. Step near foot over cable and lie prone perpendicular to cable. Bend knee 90Â° so attached ankle crosses over resting straight leg nearest pulley. Adjust positioning of legs slightly away from cable pulley so slight stretch is felt in hip.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return leg to original position toward pulley and repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite direction.~Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, internal rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite bent leg moving outward. Incidentally, if knee were straight during internal rotation of thigh, foot would move inward.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7NP4-L9wSg6alo1uFZuHJbb9loDzChcvx81lAkeGjEC_zDhdnwP3Mon8aajY&amp;s~5~2170000

Place foot of stationary leg just forward of foot attached to cable. Grasp bench and handle bar on cable column if available. Position thighs of both legs side by side, perpendicular to cable. Raise foot attached to cable slightly off of floor.~Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far as possible. Return foot behind stationary foot and toward pulley. Repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.~Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor, thereby anchoring lower body as hip abductors keep thighs in place.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTsUzTl0x7wdNHvlU56tVJkPv9JfIN3KnBKeN9K0jisEYjM6Wzlza6-EUqllug&amp;s~7~1290000

Continue alternating leg positions.~Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. Conversely, it may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, which is not practical with alternating leg movements.
