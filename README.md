The file structure of our project is as follows:
    backendTest: Folder that contains sample call to backend api using axios and copy of db.py --> python rest api that connects front and backend.

    gainzmaster: Folder that contains all vue files used for the project. All .vue files can be found within the src subfile and the html distribution live on the group vm can be found in the dist subfolder. The majority of the files that directly influence the frontend are contained within src/views and src/components.
