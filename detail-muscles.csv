Anterior~2~1~Shoulder (Front),Front Delts~Anterior Deltoid (1 of 3),Lateral DeltoidPosterior Deltoid~~The anterior deltoid is involved in the shoulder abducted when the shoulder is externally rotated. The anterior deltoid is only a weak synergist in strict transverse flexion, assisting the pectoralis major, but not transverse adduction, meaning the shoulder needs to be internally rotated to be recruited in the transverse plane.Due to increasing moment arm with abduction, anterior deltoid is more effective at shoulder abductor in higher abduction angles in contrast to supraspinatus which is more effective shoulder abductor at lower abduction angles.
Lateral~3~1~Shoulder (Side),Side Delts~Lateral Deltoid (1 of 3 Deltoids),Anterior DeltoidPosterior Deltoid~~The lateral deltoid is involved in shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated. It is involved in shoulder flexion when the shoulder is internally rotated. It is involved in shoulder transverse abduction (shoulder externally rotated) but is not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated).Due to increasing moment arm with abduction, lateral deltoid is more effective at shoulder abductor in higher abduction angles in contrast to supraspinatus which is more effective shoulder abductor at lower abduction angles.
Posterior~4~1~Shoulder (Rear),Rear Delts~Posterior Deltoid (1 of 3 Deltoids),Anterior DeltoidLateral Deltoid~~The posterior deltoid is a stronger transverse extensor (shoulder internally rotated) than transverse abductor (shoulder externally rotated). It is strongly involved in transverse extension, particularly since the latissimus dorsi is very weak in strict transverse extension. The posterior deltoid is the primary shoulder hyperextensor, since the pectoralis major nor the latissimus dorsi does not extend the shoulder beyond anatomical position (aka hyperextension)
Supraspinatus~5~1~Rotatory Cuff,Shoulder~Supraspinatus~Subscapularis,Infraspinatus,Teres Minor~Due to decreasing moment arm with abduction, supraspinatus is a more effective shoulder abductor in scapular plane at lower abduction angles in contrast to anterior deltoid and lateral deltoid which are more effective shoulder abductors at higher abduction angles (Otis JC et al, 1994).In scapular plane, supraspinatus generates greatest abduction torque with shoulder in neutral rotation or only within slight interal or external rotation. (Liu J et al 1997; Otis JC et al, 1994).*Supraspinatus assists in external rotation when shoulder is abducted and internal rotation when shoulder is flexed (Ackland DC &amp; Pandy MG, 2011).Supraspinatus is most often injured rotator cuff muscle. The inability to smoothly abduct arm against resistance may indicate rotator cuff injury. See supraspinatus weakness.
Triceps Brachii~6~2~Arm (Rear)Triceps~Long HeadLateral HeadMedial Head~~The biarticulate long head of the triceps brachii [1 ] enters passive insufficiency through the completion of elbow flexion when the shoulders are more flexed and abducted or through the completion of shoulder flexion and abduction when the elbows are more flexed. The biarticulate long head of the triceps brachii [1 ] enters active insufficiency through the completion of elbow extension when the shoulders are more extended and adducted (other heads of the triceps become more active) or through the completion of shoulder extension and adduction when the elbows are more extended.When the shoulder is internally rotated, the ability of the long head of the triceps brachii to extend and adduct the shoulder is diminished. The shoulder must be externally rotated in order for the long head of the triceps brachii to assist shoulder adduction.
Biceps Brachii~7~2~Arm (Front)BicepsBiceps Cubiti~Long Head (Outer)Short Head (Inner)~BrachialisBrachioradialis~The biceps brachii is a stronger elbow flexor when the radioulnar joint (forearm) is supinated. The biceps brachii is a stronger forearm supinator when the elbow is flexed.During elbow flexion, motor units in the lateral portion of the long head of the biceps are preferentially activated, whereas during forearm rotation, motor units in the medial portion are preferentially activated (ter Haar Romeny 1984).During a dynamic elbow flexion, the biceps is more readily activated than the brachialis. Alternatively, the brachialis becomes more readily activated during isometric elbow flexion (Tax 1989).The biceps brachii enhances dynamic stability of the shoulder joint through initial range of motion of shoulder flexion although its moment arm is relatively small (Landin 2017).The triarticulate biceps brachii muscles, particularly the short head [2 ] enters passive insufficiency through the completion of elbow extension when the shoulders are more extended or through the completion of shoulder extension when the elbows are more extended. The triarticulate biceps brachii muscles, particularly the short head [2 ] enters active insufficiency through the completion of elbow flexion when the shoulders are more flexed (brachialis becomes more active) or through the completion of shoulder flexion when the elbows are more flexed.ReferencesLandin D, Thompson M, Jackson MR (2017).

Brachialis~8~2~Arm (Side)Lower Biceps~Brachialis~Biceps BrachiiBrachioradialis~The brachialis muscle belly is located towards the distal half of the arm and is largely covered by biceps brachii.The brachialis flexes the arm along with other elbow flexor muscles, whether in pronation or supination. It is the only pure elbow flexor since it pulls on the ulna which does not rotate. (Thompson &amp; Floyd 1994)At the initiation of elbow flexion, the brachialis is highly activated since its line of pull is more perpendicular to the ulna as compared to the biceps&#39; insertion to the radius.The brachialis becomes more readily activated during isometric elbow flexion. During a dynamic elbow flexion, the biceps is more readily activated than the brachialis. (Tax 1989)
Brachioradialis~9~3~Forearm (Upper-outer),Supinator longus (out dated)~Brachioradialis~BrachialisBiceps Brachii~The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the radioulnar joint (forearm) is in a midposition between supination and pronation. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes.

The triarticulate and biarticulate wrist flexor muscles [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ] may independently enter active insufficiency through the completion of one of 4 concentric joint movements (movements of the wrist, fingers, thumb, elbow) when an adjacent joint concentric movement is sustained.The Palmaris Longus is absent on one or both sides in about 21% of people.

Trapezius Upper~15~4~Shoulder (Upper),Upper Traps~Upper Fibers (1 of 3)  Part I,Part II,Middle Fibers,Lower Fibers~Levator Scapulae~Johnson (1994) argues that the essentially transverse orientation of the upper and middle fibres of the trapezius precludes any action as elevators of the scapula as commonly depicted. Instead, the action of these fibres is to raise the scapula by rotating the clavicle about the sternoclavicular joint or to draw the scapula and clavicle backward.The biarticulate cranial fibers of the upper trapezius [1 ] enters passive insufficiency through the completion of scapula depression when the neck is flexed, laterally flexed and rotated to the opposite side or through the completion of neck flexion, lateral flexion and rotation when the opposite scapula is depressed. The biarticulate cranial fibers of the upper trapezius [1 ] enters active insufficiency through the completion of scapula elevation when the neck is extended, laterally flexed and rotated to the same side or through the completion of neck hyperextension, laterally flexion and rotation when the scapula is elevated to the same side.
Trapezius Middle~16~4~Back (Upper),Traps~Middle Fibers (1 of 3),Upper Fibers,Lower Fibers~Rhomboids~Johnson (1994) argues that the essentially transverse orientation of the upper and middle fibres of trapezius precludes any action as elevators of the scapula as commonly depicted. Instead, the action of these fibres is to raise the scapula by rotating the clavicle about the sternoclavicular joint or to draw the scapula and clavicle backwards.
Trapezius Lower~17~4~Back (Middle),Lower Traps~Lower Fibers (1 of 3),Upper Fibers,Middle Fibers~Rhomboids~The lower trapezius is important for shoulder function due to its mobility and posturing of the scapula. Lower trapezius activity is typically relatively low at angles less than 90° of scapular abduction, abduction, and flexion, and then increases exponentially from 90° to 180°. Exercises that result in a greater lower trapezius to upper trapezius ratio included shoulder external rotation at 0° abduction and prone horizontal abduction at 90° abduction with shoulder externally rotated (McCabe RA et al, 2007; Cools AM et al, 2003).
Levator Scapulae~18~4~Shoulder (Upper),Neck (Rear)~Levator Scapulae~Trapezius, Upper FibersRhomboids~The Levator Scapulae holds the scapula against the trunk.The biarticulate levator scapulae enters passive insufficiency through the completion of scapula depression and upward rotation when the neck is laterally flexed and rotated to the opposite side or through the completion of neck lateral flexion and rotation when the opposite scapula is depressed and rotated upward. The biarticulate levator scapulae enters active insufficiency through the completion of scapula elevation and downward rotation when the neck is laterally flexed and rotated to the same side or through the completion of neck lateral flexion and rotation when the scapula is elevated and rotated downward to the same side.
Rhomboids~19~4~Back (Middle)~Rhomboids Minor,Rhomboids Major~TrapeziusMiddle FibersLower Fibers~The Rhomboids holds the scapula against the thoracic wall.
Subscapularis~20~4~Rotator Cuff,Back~Superior,Middle,Inferior~Supraspinatus,Infraspinatus,Teres Minor~All heads of subscapularis have their largest internal rotation moment arm (approximately 2.5 cm) and torque generation at 0° abduction. As the abduction angle increases, moment arms of inferior and middle heads stay relatively constant, while moment arm of superior head progressively decreases until it is about 1.3 cm at 60° shoulder abduction (Otis JC, et al. 1994). However, no significant difference in upper subscapularis activity was observed during shoulder internal rotation exercises at 0°, 45°, or 90° adduction (Kadaba MP, et al. 1992; Decker MJ, et al. 2003).The literature is mixed and inconclusive as to what position to perform internal rotation exercises (0° versus 90° adduction). However, it is interesting to note greater assistance of other muscles (Pectoralis Major, Latissimus Dorsi, and Teres Major) when performing shoulder internal rotation exercises at 0° as opposed to 90° shoulder abduction (Decker MJ, et al. 2003).Subscapularis also generates abduction torque during arm elevation, particularly superior head when shoulder is externally rotated (Otis JC, et al. 1994). Subscapularis has peak abductor moment arm of 1 cm at 0° abduction, with a gradual decrease to 0 cm at 60° abduction in neutral rotation (Liu J et al. 1997).
General Chest~21~5~
Pectoralis Major Sternal~22~5~Chest,Lower Pecs~Sternal Head (1 of 2 )~Pectoralis Minor~The sternal head of the pectoralis major is a stronger shoulder transverse flexor (shoulder internally rotated) than transverse adductor (shoulder externally rotated). It is a stronger shoulder adductor when the shoulder is internally rotated. It is also a stronger shoulder extensor when the shoulder is internally rotated. Incidentally, the sternal head of the pectoralis major does not extend the shoulder beyond anatomical position (shoulder hyperextension).The biarticulate sternal head of the pectoralis major enters passive insufficiency through the completion of shoulder transverse extension or transverse abducted when the shoulder girdle is more retracted or through the completion of shoulder abduction when the scapula is more rotated upward and elevated.

Rectus Abdominis~26~6~Waist (Belly),Abdominal,Abs~Rectus Abdominis~Obliques~Rectus abdominis controls the tilt of the pelvis and curvature of the lower spine. It also tilts pelvis forward improving the mechanical positioning of the erector spinae. See abdominal weakness.

The biarticulate rectus femoris [1 ] enters active insufficiency  through the completion of knee extension when the hips are more flexed (other heads of the quadriceps [2, 3, 4 ] become more active) or through the completion of hip flexion when the knees are more extended (other hip flexors  become more active).See vastus medialis weakness  [4].

Hamstrings~36~8~Thigh (Rear)~Biceps Femoris, Long Head,Biceps Femoris, Short Head,Semitendinosus,Semimembranosus~Gluteus MaximusGastrocnemiusSartoriusGracilis~The biarticulate hamstring muscles [1, 3, 4 ] enter passive insufficiency through the completion of knee extension when the hips are more flexed or through the completion of hip flexion when the knees are more extended. The biarticulate hamstring muscles [1, 3, 4 ] enter active insufficiency through the completion of knee flexion when the hips are more extended (short head of biceps femoris [2 ] becomes more active) or through the completion of hip extension when the knees are more flexed (gluteus maximus becomes more active).Hamstring inflexibility is common in modern society. This may be explained by the principles of detraining (aka &#34;use it or lose it&#34;). Except in some cultures, we rarely keep the hamstring limber by sitting on the ground, bending over regularly, etc. as our ancestors had. It is only relatively recently, as far as evolutionary time is concerned, we stopped performing manual labor and began regularly sitting in chairs for prolonged periods of time.Also see hamstrings weakness.

General Calves~38~9~
Gastrocnemius~39~9~Calf~Medial Head,Lateral Head~Soleus~The biarticulate gastrocnemius muscle [1, 2 ] enters passive insufficiency through the completion of ankle dorsal flexion when the knees are more extended or through the completion of knee extension when the ankles are more dorsal flexed. The biarticulate gastrocnemius muscle [1, 2 ] enters active insufficiency through the completion of knee flexion when the ankles are more plantar flexed (hamstrings become more active) or through the completion of ankle plantar flexion when the knees are more flexed (soleus becomes more active). In the seated calf raise (knees flexed to 90º), the gastrocs are virtually inactive while the load is borne almost entirely by the soleus.In moderate force, the soleus is preferentially activated in the concentric phase, whereas the gastrocnemius is preferentially activated in the eccentric phase. The gastrocnemius becomes even more activated at higher lengthening velocities (Nardone &amp; Schiepatti, 1988). During hopping, the gastrocnemius, with its greater proportion of fast twitch motor units, is preferentially activated over the soleus (Moritani et al., 1990). During stationary cycling, the gastrocnemius is also preferentially activated at higher pedaling speeds (Duchateau et al., 1986).Also see Calf Exercise Analyses and Dorsiflexion Inflexibility.
