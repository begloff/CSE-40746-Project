Anterior~2~1~Shoulder (Front),Front Delts~Anterior Deltoid (1 of 3),Lateral DeltoidPosterior Deltoid~~The anterior deltoid is involved in the shoulder abducted when the shoulder is externally rotated. The anterior deltoid is only a weak synergist in strict transverse flexion, assisting the pectoralis major, but not transverse adduction, meaning the shoulder needs to be internally rotated to be recruited in the transverse plane.Due to increasing moment arm with abduction, anterior deltoid is more effective at shoulder abductor in higher abduction angles in contrast to supraspinatus which is more effective shoulder abductor at lower abduction angles.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvLtUAAiNEuyVruH8MmCw8HdLrngkUcAHSxcWV9axZlBiWmYPCaIEbjNC7zbo&amp;s

The posterior deltoid is the primary shoulder hyperextensor, since the pectoralis major nor the latissimus dorsi does not extend the shoulder beyond anatomical position (aka hyperextension)~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTfskfJaK37tWFN3doSB66sOso2t76fMQVO-iZ2gdbXZxHIUVfcR1M8s1nlIA&amp;s
Supraspinatus~5~1~Rotatory Cuff,Shoulder~Supraspinatus~Subscapularis,Infraspinatus,Teres Minor~Due to decreasing moment arm with abduction, supraspinatus is a more effective shoulder abductor in scapular plane at lower abduction angles in contrast to anterior deltoid and lateral deltoid which are more effective shoulder abductors at higher abduction angles (Otis JC et al, 1994).In scapular plane, supraspinatus generates greatest abduction torque with shoulder in neutral rotation or only within slight interal or external rotation. (Liu J et al 1997; Otis JC et al, 1994).*Supraspinatus assists in external rotation when shoulder is abducted and internal rotation when shoulder is flexed (Ackland DC &amp; Pandy MG, 2011).Supraspinatus is most often injured rotator cuff muscle. The inability to smoothly abduct arm against resistance may indicate rotator cuff injury.

Biceps Brachii~7~2~Arm (Front)BicepsBiceps Cubiti~Long Head (Outer)Short Head (Inner)~BrachialisBrachioradialis~The biceps brachii is a stronger elbow flexor when the radioulnar joint (forearm) is supinated. The biceps brachii is a stronger forearm supinator when the elbow is flexed.During elbow flexion, motor units in the lateral portion of the long head of the biceps are preferentially activated, whereas during forearm rotation, motor units in the medial portion are preferentially activated (ter Haar Romeny 1984).During a dynamic elbow flexion, the biceps is more readily activated than the brachialis. Alternatively, the brachialis becomes more readily activated during isometric elbow flexion (Tax 1989).The biceps brachii enhances dynamic stability of the shoulder joint through initial range of motion of shoulder flexion although its moment arm is relatively small (Landin 2017).The triarticulate biceps brachii muscles, particularly the short head [2 ] enters passive insufficiency through the completion of elbow extension when the shoulders are more extended or through the completion of shoulder extension when the elbows are more extended. The triarticulate biceps brachii muscles, particularly the short head [2 ] enters active insufficiency through the completion of elbow flexion when the shoulders are more flexed (brachialis becomes more active) or through the completion of shoulder flexion when the elbows are more flexed.ReferencesLandin D, Thompson M, Jackson MR (2017).

Brachialis~8~2~Arm (Side)Lower Biceps~Brachialis~Biceps BrachiiBrachioradialis~The brachialis muscle belly is located towards the distal half of the arm and is largely covered by biceps brachii.The brachialis flexes the arm along with other elbow flexor muscles, whether in pronation or supination. It is the only pure elbow flexor since it pulls on the ulna which does not rotate. (Thompson &amp; Floyd 1994)At the initiation of elbow flexion, the brachialis is highly activated since its line of pull is more perpendicular to the ulna as compared to the biceps&#39; insertion to the radius.The brachialis becomes more readily activated during isometric elbow flexion. During a dynamic elbow flexion, the biceps is more readily activated than the brachialis.

Brachioradialis~9~3~Forearm (Upper-outer),Supinator longus (out dated)~Brachioradialis~BrachialisBiceps Brachii~The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the radioulnar joint (forearm) is in a midposition between supination and pronation. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes.~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ9pdJUIhdvO4FrkSf7HmXKsfwaiSYEy4n4IL2PCWWd5atLktzCJoyoVJd-mg&amp;s

Trapezius Lower~17~4~Back (Middle),Lower Traps~Lower Fibers (1 of 3),Upper Fibers,Middle Fibers~Rhomboids~The lower trapezius is important for shoulder function due to its mobility and posturing of the scapula. Lower trapezius activity is typically relatively low at angles less than 90° of scapular abduction, abduction, and flexion, and then increases exponentially from 90° to 180°. Exercises that result in a greater lower trapezius to upper trapezius ratio included shoulder external rotation at 0° abduction and prone horizontal abduction at 90° abduction with shoulder externally rotated (McCabe RA et al, 2007; Cools AM et al, 2003).~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQe0vTRHi70Kf3wvCxfKCO9oo6KVNdELhA4AZKKXLr7Oq3by-gua34zsJn0ZA&amp;s

Subscapularis~20~4~Rotator Cuff,Back~Superior,Middle,Inferior~Supraspinatus,Infraspinatus,Teres Minor~All heads of subscapularis have their largest internal rotation moment arm (approximately 2.5 cm) and torque generation at 0° abduction. As the abduction angle increases, moment arms of inferior and middle heads stay relatively constant, while moment arm of superior head progressively decreases until it is about 1.3 cm at 60° shoulder abduction (Otis JC, et al. 1994). However, no significant difference in upper subscapularis activity was observed during shoulder internal rotation exercises at 0°, 45°, or 90° adduction (Kadaba MP, et al. 1992; Decker MJ, et al. 2003).The literature is mixed and inconclusive as to what position to perform internal rotation exercises (0° versus 90° adduction). However, it is interesting to note greater assistance of other muscles (Pectoralis Major, Latissimus Dorsi, and Teres Major) when performing shoulder internal rotation exercises at 0° as opposed to 90° shoulder abduction (Decker MJ, et al. 2003).Subscapularis also generates abduction torque during arm elevation, particularly superior head when shoulder is externally rotated (Otis JC, et al. 1994). Subscapularis has peak abductor moment arm of 1 cm at 0° abduction, with a gradual decrease to 0 cm at 60° abduction in neutral rotation (Liu J et al. 1997).~https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQDLjac-GCg5keZrbywylaerSjKEUVmA_LDBKpZnixk3xFGZ77-RrkCvoyChw&amp;s
